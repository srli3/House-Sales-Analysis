# House-Sales-Analysis


#### Introduction

  For decades, house sale price forecasting has always been a hot topic. Unlike macroeconomists who make predictions of the housing market according to the economic situation, people usually would estimate the price of a certain house based on variables such as the size, location, and condition of the house. For this project, multiple models were built to investigate how internal and external factors would influence the sale price.
