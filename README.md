# House-Sales-Analysis


#### Introduction

 For decades, house sale price forecasting has always been a hot topic. Unlike macroeconomists who make predictions of the housing market according to the economic situation, people usually would estimate the price of a certain house based on variables such as the size, location, and condition of the house. For this project, I decided to build models on house prices in order to investigate how internal and external factors would influence the sale price.
